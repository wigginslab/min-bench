An experimental minimalistic Lean Workbench. This product is specifically designed to help
NYCRIN I-Corps teams before and after the 6-week intensive I-Corps program.

   MongoDB server, use `mongod --dbpath <database path>`.

2. Next, install python requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the tornado server via `python app.py`

Todos
